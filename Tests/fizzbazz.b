Our coding shall begin at once!

£counter is now 0;

while the next statement is correct: (£counter is smaller than 100) please do as follow{
   £foo is now null;
   In Case It Is True That(£counter%3 is, in fact 0){
        £foo should be added with the following string: "fizz";
   }
   In Case It Is True That(£counter%5 is, in fact 0){
        £foo should be added with the following string: "buzz";
   }
   In Case It Is True That(£foo is not null){
        Show My Readers £foo;
   }
   But what if none of the above is true? well, in that case{
   	    Show My Readers £counter;
   }
   And then go down a line if you may.
   £counter should be raised by one.
}

And that was it my good fellas!
