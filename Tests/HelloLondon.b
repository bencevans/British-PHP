Our coding shall begin at once!

£myMessageToLondon is now "Hello London!";

In Case It Is True That (£myMessageToLondon Is, in fact "Hello London!"){
	Show My Readers £myMessageToLondon;
}
And on the possibility that (£myMessageToLondon Is not "Hello London!"){
	Show My Readers "Alfred! have you lost my message again?";
}
But what if none of the above is true? well, in that case{
	Show My Readers "What in god's name is going on here?!";
}
And that was it my good fellas!
